| Procedure/What was examined  | -Used samples from NutriNet-Sant√© ( an extensive national nutritional survey conducted in France), -The amount of Neu5Gc sugar in different dairy and meat foods usually found in the french diet was measured by Salam Bashir a PhD student, -The daily Neu5Gc intake of 19.621 grown-ups was calculated based on their food intake that they tracked online over several days, -They took 120 out of 19.621 participants and they checked the levels of the anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in their blood, -With all those informations, they created an index : "Gcemic index" in which different types of food are ranked based on the increase of antibodies they induce (+ can lead possibly to an increase in the risk of cancer) in the body when they are excessively consumed  |
| Conclusions/Discovery        | -They found an interrelationship between high consumption of Neu5Gc and increased development of their antibodies which raises the risk of cancer; so eating a lot of red meat and cheese will develop a great proliferation and a different variety of the antibodies and thus people who eat a lot of meat and cheese may be at higher risk for cancer, especially colorectal cancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
