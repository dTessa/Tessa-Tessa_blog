It would take so long to write down all the things I watch, read,... in english because pretty much everything I do is in english. So I'm going to write down a few.

- Sept. 25th: I downloaded the 'BBC News' App on my phone.

- Jan. 12th: I did grammar exercises for the exam + studied the vocabulary.

- March 28th : I watched a documentary called "The earthing movie".

- March 29th  : I watched this documentary for the second time : "Better brain health".
